The last release of PaCifiST was on 1998-06-07 (0.49b), and unfortunately, I was not able to retrieve the sets of source from this version. :(
The sources are dated from 1998-11-20, and the emulator is not working properly. Mainly, the MFP emulation is broken and at this time I can't understand it back.
Too bad I was not using a proper VCS back them.

Be warned: The sources are a big mess of C and i386 assembler. I'm only publishing them for digital preservation.

Thanks to Arnaud Carr√©, coder of YM2149 and SoundBlaster part for permission to distribute the code he wrote.

To build the executable, you will need some legacy tools:
* TASM      (tested: Turbo Assembler 4)
* Watcom C  (tested: Watcom C 10.0)
* Gravis ultrasound SDK in gravis/ folder (not sure yet if I can distribute them)

dos4gw and pmode/w dos extenders are supported. You can use DOSBox or a DOS prompt if still have one.

The produced executable need a pacifist.ini and a TOS. If you already used PaCifiST in the past, you know these.
