     05 april 96 - Starting seriously the 68000 emulation
     10 april 96 - Almost all instructions are implemented. Emulation is
		   Horribly *slow*. Debugging starts...
     18 april 96 - Run TOS 1.0... but stay in infinite loop somewhere

v0.1 (at least something: run some 68000 code)

     24 april 96 - Add a patch to allow using a disk image. Still hangs
		   after booting.
     26 april 96 - Timer C added. emulation speeded with some macros and
		   registers use. Corrected a bug in stacks swapping when
		   changing from user to supervisor mode.
     29 april 96 - Monitor improved: Breakaccess, register/memory set,
		   VERY primitive cycles count.
     02 june  96 - Corrected a bug in shifts instructions: LSL #0,Dx is
		   LSL #8,Dx. The ST screen can now be displayed at any
		   time under the monitor. Now boot till the desktop, but
		   WITHOUT using "desktop.inf". Why???
     04 june  96 - Added a log file for catching TRAPs and stuffs. Conditional
		   compilation:Can now compile without debugging, so memory
		   access is faster and executable smaller.
     05 june 96  - When running, the ST screen is displayed (Mode 0 only).

v0.2 (st screen appears sometimes)

     12 june 96  - .INI file added. "desktop.inf" is used for SOME disks
		   images. remains a mystery. Windows and icons are not well
		   drawn. Still some bugs in 68000 emulation. Certainly for
		   SR flags.
     15 june 96  - first "public" presentation at Microtel HQ's.
     16 june 96  - ST to PC Screen conversion rewritten in ASM. light speeded.
		   More INI entries. Mouse driver started. ACIA irq added,
		   OPL is ajusted for each interrupts (VBL, ACIA, Timer C).
		   Priorities.
     18 june 96  - Mouse is OK. PC mouse movements are converted in ST
		   6301 microcontroller codes. Slow solution because for each
		   little displacement, an ACIA irq is generated (but at last
		   that works). Desktop menu trashes the screen when pulled
		   down. mouse buttons ignored(?).
     20 june 96 -  fixed many bugs in disassembly module.
		   fixed some bugs in 68000 emulation: CMPA modified X flag
		   and EOR.x Dx,Dy was performing EOR.x Dy,Dx...
		   Now windows & icons are OK.
		   More precise cycles count.
		   Added a switchable PROFILE capability.
     22 june 96 -  optimized and acurate cycles counted MOVEM (almost twice
		   faster now).
     23 june 96 -  timer rewritten in C
		   added a "break on opcode" function in monitor
		   fixed a bug in DIVS
		   fixed a bug with use of strcpy()
     25 june 96 -  all ASM files converted to IDEAL mode. TASM a bit faster.
		   MOVEM.L <regs>,-(Ax) is very fast now (when in RAM)
     30 june 96 -  corrected a bug in image disk reading. Xbios now patched
		   now for direct disk access. works fine now.
		   support for direct reading of an ST disk in a PC drive.
		   simple and double density disks are OK. programs can be
		   run! editor in Devpac is trashy.
      2 july 96    Start optimizing MOVEs instructions.
      3 july 96    improved screen conversion. redraw only modified areas.
		   starting to write a low-level keyboard routine.
		   -> speed gain in 3 day is about 60%

v0.22 (system is a little useable)

      6 july 96    the 3 standard shifter modes supported.
      7 july 96    started mounting a PC drive on ST drive C.
     12 july 96    many gemdos functions work well with mounted drives now.
		   corrected a bug in CHK mem,Dx : GEMbench runs now but
		   the results are completly buggy...
     14 july 96    now disks (images & mounts) can be written on.
     19 july 96    optimizing some general routines in speed & size (SR
		   conversion). Fixed colors in low rez.
     28 july 96    modified movem.w from mem. Now COLONIAL CONQUEST runs!!
		   but stay in infinite loop when creating a new game...
    8 august 96    added TAS instruction (needed in TOS 1.62)
		   this TOS still bug later on... is a blitter needed?
   10 august 96    "trap" function in monitor can filter exceptions.
		    add INI directive trapirq.

v0.23 (a VERY few programs are OK)

   11 august 96    NEW: pmode exceptions handler to prevent (some) crashes.
		   display VERY LAST 68000 PC & last accessed location.
   12-28 august 96 hardware registers accesses completly rewritten, a bit
		   slower but easily maintainable. a huge work
   19 september 96 Bus error generated on invalid hardware registers memory.
		   SHIFTing keys OK. Source code is now 22000+ lines long
		   (mixed C & ASM), i.e. about 600Kb.
   28 september 96 added ABCD instruction (for STUNT CAR RACER to...start).
		   modified bytes push on stack.
   30 september 96 added SBCD (needed by IK+ to start (it crashes anyway...))
      1 october 96 fixed a bug in DIVU/DIVS. KRAM ok.

v0.24 (starting to make pacifist more reliable)

    17 november 96 binary load function under monitor
		   fsfirst/fsnext fixed for time/date/size
		   added "fastvideo" directive in INI file
		   an analogic joystick support in auto mode
    18 november 96 rewritten interrupt processing
		   started to implement output to parallel port
		   started to emulate the YM sound chip
    19 november 96 added autoconf of soundblaster via environment variable

v0.25 (still very buggy sound, buggy parallel, buggy joystick)

    28 november 96 added global & local relative speeds calculation
    29 november 96 timer more acurate, sound...sounds better
    30 november 96 added gemdos fdatime(), dfree(), frename() emulation.
		   BIG WORK: You should soon be able to mount be any PC
		   ========= directory as an Atari drive. Disabled
			     because all GEMDOS functions aren't yet
			     supported. All filenames are translated,
			     so it is (a little) slower.
			     Wait v0.3 for this kind feature!
    2 december 96  started to support TIMER B in events count mode (HBL)
		   ST reset function added.
   15 december 96  added hard reset function for programs that handle
		   reset. Sound almost great now.
		   added specific move.b (a7)+,... AN COOL player OK
		   movem.w now with sign extended, GENST starts.
   19 december 96  now PC hi-order byte is no more cleared. It is necessary
		   for bombs display as TOS keeps the exception number
		   in this byte.
   20 december 96  mirroring AY ports for tricky playroutines (using movem...)
		   to work. now V Flag is 100% correct with DIVU/DIVS.
		   added a step over function in monitor.
		   ARRRG!! stzip was using move.b d(Ax,Ry),-(a7)! Ok now.
		   more keyboard commands added: absolute mouse,...

v0.3 (this version is stable)

   20 december 96  now PaCifiST is supplied with an external program to help
		   you building disk images.
   21 december 96  added events count mode TIMER A, not very acurate but
		   suficient in many case (max freq is an IRQ per rasterline).
		   started to support sample playing (must buferize all YM
		   accesses!)... I want to play INTERPHASE!
   26 december 96  started experimental BIOS-level serial emulation.
		   fixed a bug in dta with gemdos search functions.
		   IMGBUILD can now create blank image disk (DD or even
		   multi-megabytes ones)
   27 december 96  output to parallel port (low-level & BIOS) is now OK.
		   printer (LPT1, port 379h) detection works as well.
   30 december 96  added (fake) STOP 68000 instruction.
		   started some kind of FDC emulation. Just some Commands
		   (Restore, Seek, Step in/out & ReadSector) supported.
   31 december 96  added FDC drive/side selection, Added FDC Step command.
     1 january 97  added (non definitive) TRACE mode support
		   added disk format calculation in case of invalid boot
		   sector informations.
		   enhanced FDC emulation: multiple sector bit used,
		   FDC IRQ triggering added (with delay relying on DMA).
     3 january 97  FDC status register more acurate (Resolution 101 starts)
		   also two drives supported with FDC emulation now.
		   binary save command added to monitor.
		   added (temp.) disk image change function in monitor.
		   added adress error (on clr.w) exception with correct
		   stack frame for elektra demo to start.

v0.31 (disk-support low-level FDC access is supported (RO).)

     5 january 97  completly rewritten screen generation routines. Now each
		   line is processed, instead of the whole screen. A linear
		   320x200x256 videomode is needed for the moment (use UNIVBE).
     8 january 97  256 colors line-oriented screen rendering almost OK.
		   32K & 64K colors mode work as well (a bug remains but
		   should not be difficult to eradicate), more reliable
		   but MUCH slower.
    12 january 97  [made annoncement web page.]
    13 january 97  screen/line-oriented method now switchable. Added a
		   gfx mode selection box.
    14 january 97  coded in a hurry a (absolutely bad) file selector for
		   image disk-switching (still buggy but it isn't very
		   useful)
    15 january 97  bus error generated on wrong PC.
		   found a bug in 68000 emulator (or.l mem,Dx)
		   added gemdos (not very good) fgetpath() support.
    17 january 97  bus error triggered when trying to access wrong memory
		   address and... AT LEAST!!! I found why TOS1.62 didn't
		   go to the desktop:
		   I assumed that, like TOS1.0 it was only 192Kb! STUPID! ^_^;
    22 january 97  rewritten all screen rendering with a very cool method
		   (fast+small) written by Patrice Lindivat.
 24-26 january 97  intensive debugging and source remodelling.
		   more working programs: Little Colored Demo (by tEX)
    27 january 97  checked A7 (more Bus error triggered).
		   Disk switching more convenient, but hangs often!
    30 january 97  no more home-made bimodal mouse handler, now rely on
		   a driver. PaCifiST (non VBE) Works under Windows 95 now.
    1 february 97  handle double bus error -> avoid crashes.

    4 february 97  compiled first public version (with DEBUG directive ON
		   so everybody can trace 68000 programs)

v0.315 (first public release)

    5 february 97  Added new switch to IMGBUILD to allow reading side 2
		   of disk instead of side 1.
		   Fixed a bug in "animate".
		   68000 Trace now stronger and traceable... Under monitor!
  6-7 february 97  more MFP stuffs: fixed Timer B, Added Timer D (needed by
		   Super Sprint to start - still unplayable...).
    9 february 97  fixed a bug in CMPM.
   10 february 97  added commandline options to override INI (try /help).
   11 february 97  tested many programs. Buckets of games just don't work. :(
		   Minor corrections to FDC emulation, thanks to informations
		   from Alan Reeve.
   13 february 97  more tests. Fixed TAS Dx.

v0.32 - READY on 14 February 97

v0.32a - READY on 17 February 97

   18 february 97  added commandline switches /refreshrate & /mono.
		   FDC command now triggered with .L access (WOW!)
		   Most antivirus boots will not detect something special.

    25-26 feb 97   Ulrich Doewich YM emulation ported to 32 bits, rewritten
		   sound IRQ. Tested with SB.
		   If no PC Joystick is found, Arrows & CTRL are used to
		   simulate a Joystick in Port 1.
		   IOPL after an exception now ok.
    27 feb 97      Coded a short 6301 Disassembler to study the Atari Keyboard
		   ROM. It allows me to understand more how it works.
		   Written a more compatible 6301 emulation. Added a monitor
		   command to put values in keyboard buffer.
		   Gained a few kilobytes in EXE.

v0.34 - OK on 28 Fev 97 - Still no sound, 90% joystick & mouse emulation

    1 march 97     System date & time is kept within emulation, but due
		   to the timings used, it should be somewhat bogus.
		   Autorun directive added.
    3 march 97     Some keyboard stuffs added: reset, help & undo keys.
    4 march 97     Fixed ILLEGAL instruction.
		   YM emulation from Arnaud Carre merged into emulator. More
		   maintainable than Ulrich routine. Not definitive.

v0.35 - OK on 5 March 97 - Sound with some SB compatible cards


    5 march 97     Add Native PC speed support. Ok for gemdos apps.
		   In order to allow the definition of RAM amount at startup,
		   I had to rewrite all memory accesses in 68000 emulation
		   core. Hard & boring to do... But the speed will be
		   boosted.
    6 march 97     add ramsize directive.
		   NBCD utterly wrong.
		   STOP #$2100 ok with $68 irq.
		   fixed monochrome colors in a *stupid* (but working) way.

   14-16 march 97  crash handled with DPMI function 203.
		   EA calculation a (little) bit faster. Use only EAX & EDI
		   In "no debug" version, speed gain from v0.35 is about 30%!
v0.4 beta 2

   17 march 97     Mousebuttons in absolute mouse mode now work if they are
		   mapped on keys.
		   rewritten HBL handling. More acurate rasters.
   18 march 97     Add ZIP archives support in diskselector. Quickly done,
		   but seems to be ok. PKUNZIP must be in the PATH.
   19 march 97     AT LEAST!!! Mousebuttons function in absolute mouse mode.
		   directive for sound disabling.
   20 march 97     Global volume selection. Serial disabling option.
  21-22 march 97   Tests - Documentation for the emulator: So booOOOooring
		   to write!!! I *HATE* writing docs.

   25-26 march 97  Some MFP routines rewritten
   27 march 97     68000 Prefetch Emulated (Switchable, because it takes
		   time - default is OFF). Stack frame now handles invalid
		   address value on bus/address error (necessary for the BIG
		   DEMO which trigger address errors to decode itself. Anyway,
		   without a patch in a Timer B irq, the demo is too slooooow)
   28 march 97     code remodeling, in order to minimize cache defaults.
		   68000 emulation is 30Kb shorter than in v0.4.
   29 march 97     tests for STF samples support.
  1st april 97     build-in MSA support (read only), compressed or not.

    7 april 97     Fixed Xbios() read/write sectors.
    8 april 97     Protected mode interface no more needed (ok with S3VBE).
		   External mouse sensitivity tunable. Mouse mode 0xa now
		   supported (Joust sequence in Defender of the Crown).
 10-11 april 97    Reset from Disk selection screen. Direct PC drive
		   support (not recommended!!!)
